### Creating App Icons
We can create various sized icons in https://appicon.co/. From the generated files, 
  - `android` folder contents (mipmap* files) should be moved to project/app/src/main/res/ after deleting the existing mipmap* folders. 
  - For ios, the folder to be replaced is ios/Runner/Assets.xcassets
