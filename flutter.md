### Creating App Icons
We can create various sized icons in https://appicon.co/ and downoad them. 
  - delete `mipmap*` folders from `android/app/src/main/res` of the project and copy the `android\mipmap*` from the downloaded files.
  - For ios, replace the ios/Runner/Assets.xcassets with the downloaded Assets.xcassets folder
